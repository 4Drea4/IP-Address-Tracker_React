### Project Scope 
The goal of this project is to take the IP Address Tracker project originally done in HTML, CSS and Javascript and repurpose it for Typescript and React given what I now know. 

The IP Address Tracker uses the IP Geolocation API by IPify. Users are able to:
 - See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
 - Search for any IP Addresses or domains and see the key information and location
 - View the optimal layout for each page 
 - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Reflection
 #### Development Process / High level overview: Planning
 - I set up the vite project
 - Began Outlining the project requirements 
 - I will build the UI first utilizing what I had in the last project
 - I have been reviewing my code and seeing where I can now implement React for rendering state, having a controlled form, and maybe validation.
 - Turn old logic into a custom hook
 - Deploy a live version
